= rhc:latest

This is a Fedora 22 based OpenShift Client tools, known as rhc,
container image. It's best used if you use some volumes with it.

It also includes Ruby on Rails 4.2, but no docs!

= Prerequisites

A host running docker, I prefere Fedora 22 on my laptop.

= Installation

Simple install the rhc container image from hub.docker.com by `docker
pull b4mad/rhc`

Please create a few directories, they will carry tokens, credentials
and the source itself: `mkdir -p $HOME/.rhc/git $HOME/.rhc/openshift
$HOME/.rhc/ssh $HOME/workspace/rhc`

= Usage

Run a container using `docker run --rm -ti -p 3000 -v
$HOME/.rhc/git:/root/.git -v $HOME/workspace/rhc:/root/src -v
/home/goern/.rhc/openshift:/root/.openshift -v
/home/goern/.rhc/ssh:/root/.ssh rhc /bin/bash`, this will bind a few
volumes, expose a port and run a bash so you can work...
